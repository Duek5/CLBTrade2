Rename the file .env-sample to .env and replace the value of SECRET_KEY with the secret key of your own project. To generate a new secret key
Go to terminal and create a new django project django-admin startproject <proj-name>.
Now get the value of SECRET_KEY in settings.py and use that as the secret key for the CLB project.
Now delete that new django project.
